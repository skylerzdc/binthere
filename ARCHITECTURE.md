# Architecture

binthere is a **single Cloudflare Worker** that serves both the static frontend and the paste
API, backed by KV and a Durable Object. Consolidating everything into one Worker (one deploy,
one `wrangler.toml`) keeps the security-sensitive integration surface small.

```

- `_headers` (in `public/`) applies the strict CSP + security headers to every asset response.
- `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` makes `/p/<id>` serve `index.html`; the
  client reads the id from the path and the key from the `#fragment`.
- `GET /api/stars` is the one route outside the paste path: it proxies the repository's public
  star count for the topbar badge, since the page cannot reach `api.github.com` itself under
  `connect-src 'self'`. The answer is the same for every visitor, says nothing about them, and
  is cached at the edge and in the browser (30 min) so page loads don't become GitHub requests.

## Zero-knowledge boundary

The decryption key is a random 256-bit **fragment secret `F`**, base64url-encoded after `#`.
The browser never puts `F` (or the plaintext) into any request. The Worker only ever sees:
ciphertext, a wrapped content key, non-secret `adata` (IVs, KDF params, format flags), the
expiry option, and — server-side only — a `SHA-256` of the delete token. See `SPEC.md`.

## Storage routing (by id prefix)

Paste ids carry a 1-char class prefix so the read path picks the backend with **no extra
lookup**, and the client knows a burn paste is single-use *before* fetching it:

- `k…` → **KV** (`PASTES`). Immutable value `{ p: paste, dth }`, native `expirationTtl`.
  Reads are idempotent; eventual consistency is fine because the value never changes.
- `b…` → **`BurnPaste` Durable Object**, addressed `idFromName(id)`. The value lives in DO
  storage. Every mutation runs inside `blockConcurrencyWhile`, so read-and-delete is atomic:
  the first `consume()` returns the ciphertext and deletes it; concurrent/later reads get
  `gone` → HTTP `410`. A **non-consuming peek** (`GET …?meta=1`) returns only `adata` + the
  wrapped key — never the ciphertext — so the client can verify a password *before* the single
  destructive read (`SPEC.md` §8). Expiry is a DO `alarm` plus a lazy check on read.

```
create ─┬─ bar=false ─▶ id="k…" ─▶ PASTES.put(id, {p, dth}, {expirationTtl})
        └─ bar=true  ─▶ id="b…" ─▶ BURN.get(idFromName(id)).create(paste, dth, ttl)

read   ─┬─ id[0]="k" ─▶ PASTES.get → 200 | 404
        ├─ id[0]="b" ─▶ BURN…consume() → 200 (once) | 410
        └─ id[0]="b" + ?meta=1 ─▶ BURN…peek() → 200 head (no consume) | 410
```

## Modules

Shared, format-defining code lives in `public/js/` so the **browser imports it as a static
asset** and the **Worker bundles the same file** — one source of truth for the wire format:

| Module | Runs in | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `public/js/bytes.js` | browser + worker + tests | base64url, SHA-256, CSPRNG bytes, constant-time hex compare |
| `public/js/format.js` | browser + worker + tests | paste format v1 validation (fail-closed) + canonical AAD + expiry map |
| `public/js/crypto.js` | browser + tests | the protocol: PBKDF2/HKDF/AES-GCM, gzip with decompression cap |
| `public/js/markdown.js` | browser + tests | safe Markdown → DOM (no raw HTML, href allowlist) |
| `public/js/highlight.js` | browser + tests | code detection + `textContent`-only syntax highlighting |
| `public/js/{api,ui,app}.js` | browser | fetch client, DOM helpers, controller/router |
| `public/js/{theme,theme-init}.js` | browser | light/dark toggle; pre-paint theme apply (no flash) |
| `public/js/qrcode.js` | browser | vendored MIT `qrcode-generator` (rendered as a `data:` image) |
| `src/index.js` | worker | API routing, size guard, id allocation, error mapping |
| `src/burn-do.js` | worker | `BurnPaste` Durable Object |
| `src/lib/{ids,store,ratelimit}.js` | worker | id/token gen + hashing, KV/DO routing + expiry, rate-limit wrapper |

### The CLI client

The official CLI (`cli/`, published to npm as [`binthere`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binthere))
is a **second client of the same frozen protocol**, running in Node ≥ 20 with zero runtime
dependencies. Because npm cannot pack files outside the package root, `cli/vendor/` holds
**byte-identical copies** of `public/js/{bytes,format,crypto,qrcode}.js` (`qrcode.js` lands as
`qrcode.cjs` for Node's CommonJS loader); a drift test fails CI on any divergence, and
`node cli/scripts/sync-shared.mjs` re-aligns them — `public/js/` stays the single source of
truth. `cli/src/` is a thin consumer on top: an API client with a configurable base URL,
share-URL build/parse, `create`/`get`/`delete` commands mirroring the browser's flows
(including the safe `?meta=1` peek before a destructive burn read), and a dependency-free
interactive TUI.

## Error semantics

Unlike the legacy PrivateBin API (which returned HTTP 200 for everything and signaled errors
in the JSON body to appease jQuery), binthere uses **real status codes**: `201` create, `200`
read/delete, `400` invalid, `403` wrong delete token, `404` missing, `410` burned/expired burn,
`413` too large, `429` rate-limited. The client reads them directly. API JSON responses also
carry `cache-control: no-store` and `x-content-type-options: nosniff` (static assets get their
security headers from `public/_headers`).

## Testing

`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` runs every suite in the real `workerd` runtime, so Web
Crypto, `CompressionStream`, KV, and the Durable Object behave as in production. The burn
concurrency test fires 25 simultaneous reads and asserts exactly one `200` and the rest `410`.
The frozen crypto vectors are regenerated with `node test/genvectors.mjs` (spec-first, never
hand-edited) and independently cross-checked by a from-scratch Python implementation
(`tools/verify-vectors.py`).

The CLI has its own suites under `cli/test/`, run as a **second vitest project in plain Node**
(`npm run test:cli`; `npm test` runs both projects): the SPEC §11 vectors re-verified against
Node's WebCrypto, URL parsing, mocked-API round trips (including burn-ordering and wrong-token
assertions), TUI/QR rendering, and the vendor-drift byte-compare against `public/js/`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, a byte-for-byte diff of the regenerated vectors
against `test/vectors.expected.txt`, and both suites on every push/PR.
